Flow
- Connect to MQTT
- Connect to Serial Device
- Request current status/state from Vallox
  * some values (for example temperature) don't need to be requested, they are sent periodically
- Start listening to Vallox messages
  * parse message
  * update state
  * send updated state to MQTT (if any values have actually changed)
